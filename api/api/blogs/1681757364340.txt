<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;">Is the ideology that motivated me to start doing what I do and what still motivates me to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 14pt;"><br />I created this blog from scratch, no WordPress here! I enjoy creating things, which is a big reason I develop. I want to use what platforms I can to inspire other developers and perhaps share some of the joy that developing brings me.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>Now, about me.</strong></span><br /><br />My name is William Bojczuk. I design/develop websites and run this brand I call Grow In Code.<br /><br />I love traveling and any outdoor activity I can find time for. Crazy right? This basically cancels the stereotype that developers stay hermits in their dark rooms and never see the light of day, lol. <br /><br />I&rsquo;ve been out of the country and being able to experience another culture makes me want to travel way more often than I currently do.<br /><br />I have a significant other who lives in South Africa (she&rsquo;s moving over here soon :D ). We&rsquo;ve been together for a while and I have to give her credit for supporting me and motivating me when times get hard.</span></p>
